        <h1>What is meditation for sleep?</h1>
        <p>Meditation trains us to be less in our head and more aware of the present moment. The mind’s tendency to get caught up in thoughts is perhaps strongest at bedtime, when we suddenly stop and be still. Meditation for sleep is a specific, guided experience that offers a natural sleep aid all on its own, allowing us to let go of the day—everything that’s happened and everything that’s been said — so that we can rest the mind while simultaneously resting the body. In scientific terms, meditation helps lower the heart rate by igniting the parasympathetic nervous system and encouraging slower breathing, thereby increasing the prospect of a quality night’s sleep.</p><br><br>

        <h1 class="head">What keeps people up at night?</h1>
        <p>Almost half of us are sleep deprived –but not because we don’t want to sleep. Sometimes we simply can’t fall asleep or stay asleep due to a range of biological forces and lifestyle choices. You know how it goes: You put your head on the pillow and it appears as though the mind suddenly goes into overdrive. Of course, the thoughts have been there all along; it’s just that without any distractions, you become aware of them.</p>       
        <p>Technology has also contributed to increased sleep problems: 90% of Americans use technology during the hour before bed (this includes watching tv, using cell phones, playing video games, using computers, and more). Many of us even sleep with cell phones under our pillows or next to our faces with the ringer on. Unfortunately, mindless screen and technology use is negatively associated with solid sleep: one study showed that the more devices an individual uses in a given day, the more difficulty they may have falling and staying asleep. These effects were seen mostly in people who were highly engaged with their devices throughout the day, and even more so in those who went to sleep with their phone ringers turned on (even for use as an alarm clock) or other interruptive devices nearby.</p>

            <h1>The benefits of sleep meditation</h1>
            <p>Regularly sleeping fewer than seven hours per night increases the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, unhealthy eating habits that can lead to other chronic illnesses. Sleep deprivation can cause impairments in short and long term memory), decision making), attention), and reaction time). People who are sleep deprived also tend to make more errors at workand drive more dangerously on the road.</p>
            <p>Increased and better sleep, on the other hand, can lower levels of stress, and improve mental clarity) and memory). Improved sleep also affects our immune systems), encourages better eating habits and weight management.</p>
            <p>Why might you choose to meditate before bed? Especially if you have insomnia or difficulty falling asleep, meditation has been shown to improve the quality and efficiency of sleep, how quickly you fall asleep, and how long you can stay awake during the day.</p>

            <h1>What to expect when meditating to fall asleep</h1>
            <p>Meditation for sleep should be approached the same way we approach meditation in the daytime, gently, with a relaxed focus. When we allow the body to relax, and allow the mind to drift off, we do so in a soft, gentle way, not trying to force sleep, otherwise we encourage more thoughts and, possibly, some tension. As much as possible, allow yourself to be led by the guidance, not thinking too much about the technique or instructions.</p>
            <p>Before you begin your sleep meditation: lie flat on your back on the bed, take a few deep breaths, and close your eyes, allowing the body to begin powering down. If you’re using a guided meditation, follow the instructions. If practicing unguided meditation, progress at your own pace. The more you practice this type of meditation, the more likely you are to build a quiet and restful mind that can sleep at ease.</p>

            <h1>A simple meditation to aid sleep</h1>
            <p>If you wake up in the night, racing thoughts can contribute to keeping you awake. Your mind is whirring away, worrying about all kinds of things that might happen. A simple meditation based on counting the breaths can really help</p>
            <p>Start by scanning down through your body, looking for areas of tension and relaxation. Then begin counting your breaths, (1 for an in-breath, 2 for an out-breath, 3 for an in-breath and so on, up to 10). If your mind wanders, just bring it back to counting your breath. The idea is to step away from the worried thinking, and give your mind a different object to concentrate on for a while so you can drift back off.</p>
