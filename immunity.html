        <h2>Yoga For Immunity Boosting</h2>
        <p>Yoga boosts overall health and helps in boosting immunity too. We have given a list of yoga poses that can enhance the functioning of the immune system.</p>
        <div class="content">
        <h3><span class="count">1</span> Bow Pose</h3>
        <img src="images/immunity/bow.gif"  alt="Bow Pose"/>
        <ul>
           <li>Lie flat on your stomach. Keep your chin on the mat and your hands at your sides. Your hands should be palm up.</li>
           <li>Exhale while you bend your knees. Bring your heels as close as you can to your buttocks. Your knees should be hip-width apart.</li>
           <li>Lift your hands and take hold of your ankles. Be sure to grab the ankle and not the top part of the feet. Your fingers should wrap around the ankles, but your thumb does not. Keep your toes pointed.</li>
           <li>Inhale and lift the heels away from the buttocks, keeping a hold of your ankles. Simultaneously, lift your head, chest, and thighs away from the mat. As you lift, rotate your shoulders safely and comfortably. At this point, only your core should touch the mat, while the rest of your body is lifted towards the ceiling.</li>
           <li>Draw your tailbone into the mat to deepen the stretch. You should feel the stretch in your back as the weight and balance shifts to your core. Your chest and shoulders should feel open.</li>
           <li>Look straight ahead and hold the pose for about 15 seconds while you focus on stretching, breathing, and balancing.</li>
           <li>Exhale and release the pose. Lower your head, chest, thighs, and feet back towards the mat. Let go of your ankles and return to your hands to your side. Relax for a few seconds and repeat the pose as needed or continue to your next pose.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
        <h3><span class="count">2</span> Cobra Pose</h3>
        <img src="images/immunity/cobrapose.gif" alt="Cobra pose"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Place your palms flat on the ground directly under your shoulders. Bend your elbows straight back and hug them into your sides.</li>
            <li>Pause for a moment looking straight down at your mat with your neck in a neutral position. Anchor your pubic bone to the floor.</li>
            <li>Inhale to lift your chest off the floor. Roll your shoulders back and keep your low ribs on the floor. Make sure your elbows continue hugging your sides. Don't let them wing out to either side.</li>
            <li>Keep your neck neutral. Donâ€™t crank it up. Your gaze should stay on the floor.</li>
            <li>Exhale to release back to the floor.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="content">

        <ul>
            <li>Come up to your elbows with your forearms flat on the mat and your upper arms perpendicular to the floor.</li>
            <li>Keep your forearms in place and puff up your chest by rolling your shoulders back and tucking your shoulder blades firmly onto your back. You should feel your body creating a backbend</li>
            <li>Press your palms into the mat. You can tuck your hands under your butt if that feels like a more stable position for them.</li>
            <li>Lower the crown (very top) of your head back until it comes to the floor, opening your throat.</li>
            <li>Keep your legs engaged and your toes active throughout. </li>

           <li>Bend your arms and cross the left arm over the right, hooking at the elbows. With arms hooked, draw your forearms together and wrap your right palm around your left palm, crossing at the wrists. (Whichever leg is on top, the opposite arm should be on top.)</li>
           <li>Lift the elbows to the height of your shoulders while keeping the shoulders sliding down away from your ears.</li>
           <li>Keep your spine perpendicular to the floor and the crown of the head rising.</li>
           <li>Hold for 5 to 10 breaths.</li>
           <li>Repeat on the other side.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span class="count">5</span> Half-fish pose</h3>
        <img src="images/immunity/halffish.jpg" alt="half fish pose"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Begin seated on your mat with both legs extended out in front of you (dandasana). Bend your right knee and step your foot to the outside of your left leg. Stay here, or bend your left knee so your left foot is next to your opposite hip.</li>
            <li>Place your right hand to the ground (or a block) behind your hips. Inhale to lift your left arm high, exhale to twist to the right and hook your left elbow outside your right thigh.</li>
            <li>Root down through your sitting bones and lift through the crown of your head. On every exhale, invite a gentle twist to the right.</li>
            <li>Option to take your gaze over your right shoulder.</li>
            <li>Hold for 5 breaths then release back to center. Pause in a seated shape for a few breaths, then repeat on the other side.</li>
