            <h1>Meditation for Stress</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Life can be stressful, and stress can have serious repercussions on our health. At one time or another, many of us will have experienced that sense of being overwhelmed, as if everything were too much.</p><br><br>
        <p>Sometimes, simply taking time to pause and rest the mind can be enough to feel better in the moment, so before going any further, here’s a quick exercise to help distance yourself from stressful thoughts right away.</p>
        <h2>Relieving Stress</h2>

        <h1 class="head">Stress-buster</h1>
        <p>Meditation has been scientifically proven to help alleviate stress after just eight weeks of a regular practice.</p>
        <p>Numerous studies have shown that meditation is an effective stress-management tool, ultimately reprogramming the brain to the extent that meditators end up with more capacity to manage stress (when meditation is a consistent, daily practice).</p>
        <p>In training the mind to be more open and less reactive, we are better able to cope when life’s stressors — in career, family, relationship, college, finances, even traffic — start accumulating. But before diving into how meditation combats stress, we first need to understand what stress does to the body.</p>
        <div class="head">
            <h1>Good stress/bad stress</h1>
            <p>Meditation isn’t about eliminating stress; it’s about managing it. A lot of that boils down to how we perceive stress. By altering our mindset, we can lessen the implications on our mental and physical health.</p>
            <p>Stress often gets a bad rap, which is perhaps undeserved. Think where we would be, for example, if we didn’t have the distress signal that makes us flee from danger. Or if we didn’t feel pressed to finish a project or homework on time. Some people even thrive in high-pressure careers, feeling completely in control in the fast lane and totally stressed out when things slow down. So the degrees of stress can vary widely person to person. Nevertheless, good experiences in our best interest will still bring stress. There’s no avoiding it.</p>

            <h1>Reframing stress</h1>
            <p>Rather than being caught up in our stress, meditation teaches us to become the observers of certain mental patterns and, therefore, become less physically affected by them.</p>
            <p>Experiencing stress usually creates a story in the mind, and if we get caught up in such stories — saying things, to ourselves or others, like “I’m stressed!” — then we essentially keep ourselves in the stress, ensuring that we’ll feel that way for the rest of the day.</p>
            <p>When we meditate, we are taking the time to be curious about what we’re thinking and feeling, as though we are looking at stress through a new lens. In this deliberate reframing of our experience, we can dramatically alter how we view and relate to stress.</p>
        </div>

            <h1>FineFettle for stress</h1>
            <p>Meditation is a journey of a lifetime, not a sprint to instant progress. Take it session by session, day by day, appreciating that this is a skill that requires commitment, patience, and practice, where the benefits are felt gradually over time. There is no “good” or “bad” meditation, and there is no “succeeding” or “failing”; there is only awareness and non-awareness or distraction and non-distraction. Over time, the more the mind learns to become less distracted and the more our awareness stabilizes.</p>
