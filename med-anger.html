        </div>
        <p>Anger is a complex emotion and, for many people, a source of shame or guilt if they struggle to control their temper. Whether it’s red mist clouding the moment, a bubbling irritation that boils over, a long-held grudge finally expressed, or an injustice endured or witnessed, we’ve all experienced anger in one form or another.</p><br><br>

        <h1 class="head">Transforming anger</h1>
        <p>In meditating and in applying mindfulness in the heat of the moment, we are offered an opportunity to work with anger — whenever and however it arises — in a skillful, measured way.</p>
        <p>When any emotion rises up, we tend to first get caught up in it and then act it out, through speech or action. This couldn’t be truer for the heightened emotion of anger. Meditation, though, can teach us how to change a rash, reactive mindset into a more considered, responsive, and productive one.</p>
        <p>We start by first learning to recognize anger’s onset without stepping into it. Imagine a cauldron full of red-hot, bubbling liquid — it’s there, we see it clearly, but we can watch without reaching in and hurling cupfuls of it around the room. We don’t have to get involved.</p>
        <div class="head">
            <h1>Understanding emotional reactivity</h1>
            <p>The ability to transform anger also involves taking responsibility for the fact that our anger is a part of us, regardless of what situation presses our buttons. Few of us purposefully get angry, so familiarizing ourselves with our emotional reactivity helps us understand what makes us hot under the collar and what it brings up for us.</p>
            <p>With practice, we learn to see that anger doesn’t need to erupt in a matter of seconds; in fact, once we learn to view anger as a fleeting energy, we come to realize that we can be in control of it, not vice versa. We also come to see our anger with more clarity, realizing that it can actually be a healthy emotion if channeled in the appropriate way.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>What anger does to the body</h1>
            <p>Once we cross the threshold into extreme anger or a rageful state, the physiological reactions are the same for everyone: blood pressure increases, heart and breathing rates quicken, the muscles tighten, and our adrenaline spikes, releasing the “stress hormone” cortisol into our system as our “fight or flight” mechanism is activated. We don’t quite reach the cartoon stage of steam coming out of the ears, but there’s a lot happening internally.</p>
