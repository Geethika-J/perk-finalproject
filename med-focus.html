            <h1>Meditation for Focus</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Wouldn’t it be great if you could wave a magic wand and presto! Your memory and ability to focus have been magically enhanced! You would be more productive, your goals could be achieved with less effort, and you would find it much easier to prioritize. The resulting reduction of stress would probably make you more considerate and even more cheerful.</p><br><br>

        <h1 class="head">Breath and Focus</h1>
        <p>One of the most fundamental aspects of practicing meditation for focus is your breath. There are many ways to focus on the breath—you can be aware of each individual inhalation and exhalation or just focus on the outbreath. In any case, be aware of each breath. Notice the sensation as cool air enters your nostrils as you inhale and warm air exits as you breathe out. Feel your lungs expand and contract. Note the gentle rise and fall of your belly as you breathe. Or count each cycle of your breath as one, continue up to seven if you can and then start over again at one. The point is not to be the world’s champion breath counter, but to encourage your mind to focus by using your breath as a support for your meditation training.</p>       
        <div class="head">
            <h1>Freeze Frame</h1>
            <p>Make it a point to sit still during as much of your seated meditation session as possible. Whether you are on a chair or a cushion, keep your back straight with your head held upright. The newer you are to the practice of meditation, the more challenging this may be. If you’re like most people, you didn’t spend too much time focusing on your posture before you began meditating. You may never have noticed the body’s tendency to relax and sag – or that certain areas, such as the jaw, are stiff with tension. By paying attention and correcting your meditation posture, you are effectively working on your focus.</p>

            <h1>Reciting mantras</h1>
            <p>Reciting mantras is a popular meditation technique. When practiced with an altruistic motivation, mantras can imbed strong, positive aspirations into your consciousness. Even on an elementary level, they can be used as a focus-improvement method. A simple mantra, such as silently repeating “Breathing in, I clear my mind” on the in-breath, followed by “Breathing out, I am free” on the out-breath can be very effective for this.</p>
            <p>If your mind tends to wander while meditating—and let’s face it, whose doesn’t—a good guided meditation may keep you on track. Focus on the narrator’s words. Mindfully follow her peaceful and experienced voice as she leads you through a meditation session.</p>
