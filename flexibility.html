        <h3><span class="count">1</span> Standing bend pose</h3>
        <img src="images/flexibility/stand.gif" alt="standing bend pose" class="on-scroll"/>
        <ul>
            <li>Begin standing with the feet parallel and separated hip distance apart.</li>
            <li>Place your hands on your hips and inhale to reach the crown of the head up toward the ceiling and find length along the spine.</li>
            <li>On your next exhale, begin to hinge at the hips and fold forward over the legs, bringing the torso to flow over the legs like a waterfall.</li>
            <li>Take as much of a bend in your knees as you need to here in order to take any tension out of the low back, and allow the head to hang heavy. Either let the arms softly hang or take a hold of opposite elbows to deepen the sensation. If it feels comfortable, you can also bring the fingertips to the ground, or press the palms against the calves to move even deeper.</li>
            <li>Shift your weight slightly forward into the balls of your feet and notice how that changes the sensation in your hamstrings.</li>
            <li>To come out of the pose, take a slight bend in the knees and place the hands on the hips. With the core engaged, inhale to find a flat back and exhale all the way up to stand.</li>
